=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # One liner: transfers 'file' to all

Functions in this module are for the implementation of
the script L<parpush>. 

=head2 parpush

The main function is C<parpush>:


  ($okh, $pid) = parpush(
    configfile  => $configfile,
    destination => [ 'cluster1:/path1', 'cluster2:/path2' ],
    scp         => $scp,
    scpoptions  => $scpoptions,
    sourcefile  => $sourcefile,
  );

during the connection. The value is an anonymous list 
with the process identifiers of the connections 
(C<undef> if the fork failed) to that machine.
